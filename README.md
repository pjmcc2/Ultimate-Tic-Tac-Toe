# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
## My implementation of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe using a Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm for computer-generated moves. (WORK IN PROGRESS...slowly)
### The intital code is an unfinished university assignment that my partner and I couldn't quite figure out in time. I want to polish it up and add a GUI to made it easy to play.

NOTES ON POSITION NAMES:
  Squares on the board are named after their positions in the following manner: 
  1. The first letter represents row
  2. The second letter represents column
  3. The rows are Upper, Middle, and Bottom
  4. The columns are Left, Middle, and Right
    Example codes: UL - Upper left
                 : MM - Middle middle
                 : BR - Bottom right


UPDATE(7/22/22):
Currently it works for one move before breaking down..... I just need to implement a way to make new moves and I am golden :))
